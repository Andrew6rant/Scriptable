## Welcome to COVID Trend Widget ##

This widget will display country level stats for COVID-19 and also display a trending indicator whether the given item is trending up, down, or steady. 

The default setting has colored arrows enabled (green for good and red for bad). You can disable this by setting the colorArrows variable, to false.

The API used comes from Javier Aviles at [this link](https://github.com/javieraviles/covidAPI) which was formed from the [disease.sh repo](https://github.com/disease-sh/API). 

This widget caches data in the Scriptable iCloud Drive folder for comparison to the latest data grabbed from the api.

To setup the widget enter the country name in the widget parameter.

**Note:** If the country name doesn't work, make sure it is a valid country name by visiting [this page](https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com) and find the country by name and use that in the parameter.
